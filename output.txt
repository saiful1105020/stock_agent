Acknowledge the user's budget. Split the budget across the stocks you have recommended. Make sure the total is equal to the user's budget.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

With your budget of $100, you could consider allocating your funds equally across the selected stocks to diversify your investment. Here's a simple way to do that:

1. **Apple Inc. (AAPL)** - $16.67
2. **Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)** - $16.67
3. **Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)** - $16.67
4. **NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA)** - $16.67
5. **NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE)** - $16.67
6. **Duke Energy Corp. (DUK)** - $16.67

This allocation will give you exposure to both technology and energy sectors. With fractional shares, you can adjust this as needed, or focus more on the energy stocks if you wish.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

Please note that I am not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice. Stock investments come with inherent risks, including market volatility and the potential loss of your invested capital.

Provide a final summary of the investment advice in a structured format, including the cautions.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Allocate your $100 budget equally across Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, NVIDIA, NextEra Energy, and Duke Energy. Diversification across tech and energy provides balanced exposure to growth and sustainability sectors. Consider fractional shares for exact allocations. Remember to perform your own due diligence as I am not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice. Investments carry risk, and it's crucial to understand and accept them before investing.
